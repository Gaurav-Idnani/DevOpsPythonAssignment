# DevOpsPythonAssignment
This repository hosts the solutions to all the problem statements which were part of Python Graded Assignment.
There are solutions to 4 problems here, and the solutions to individual problems have been solutioned in python and named as solution1 , solution2 , solution 3.
The 4th solution has been named as backup.py as the naming convention was part of the question.

# Prerequisites
Individual solutions have the entire problem statement mentioned as a comment in the starting of the file. Please check that out before proceeding to the solution.
Python 3.x installed on the machine.

# Configuration
A sample config file by the name of sampleConfigFile.txt needs to be created if not created already present in the directory. As that file contains data in the format listed out in the problem statement.
The output of the said problem is contained in another file present in the directory, configReportFile.txt. This also needs to be created, if not present.

# Usage
Individual files are self sufficient units of logic that can be directly invoked in the terminal to get the outputs.


# Testing
As of now , no seperate pytest scripts are written for these problems. However , user understandable error messages have been configured in the code logic to let the user know if there's any issues.
